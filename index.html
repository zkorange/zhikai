    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Final year student from Nanyang Technological University majoring in Chemical and
Biomolecular Engineering. Currently, I'm seeking an employment opportunity in a job
related to process engineering or safety engineering.</p>

    <h2>This is a Test</h2>
<p>The writing market has changed a lot since I first got published! There are many different different paths to getting published. I can only tell you the one I took: I wrote a book (actually, many books), then found a guide called Jeff Herman’s Guide to Agents, Editors, and Publishers. I wrote to the agents in the guide what’s called a query letter. This is a one page letter describing you, your book, and why a publisher/agent would want to buy this book from you. Just to let you know, I sent out several hundred of these letters before a single person ever asked to see the book I was trying to sell.
Some of the people who wrote back asked me to give them money in order to sell my book. I personally didn’t want to take that route, as I didn’t believe it was the right path for me (especially since I didn’t have any money)! Finally one person said she would represent me for 15% of whatever my book earned if she could sell it. That person is still my agent today.</p>
